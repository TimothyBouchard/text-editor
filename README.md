# text-editor
this is a text editor customized for my liking. with useful (to me) functionality. 


Written in python3, and uses the simple tkinter gui library. For testing small systems and creating testing data i made a function that takes a two list text files and combines them togeather at random. i use this to make test data for other programs. 

i also added spell checker and real time spell checks.
in the process of adding definicians to the error word suggestions.
in process of adding definicians to any words selected. 
in process of adding fonts, sizes, color and formatting. 



** i would like to add Matlib functionality as well. 
** i would like to add a functionality for an IDE and code syntax and support, Mainly for Java, C/C++ and Python

** i would like to add more text manipulation functionality in the future. 
    (making a gui based text formatting and parsing system) This is to make the creation of datasets alot easier.
